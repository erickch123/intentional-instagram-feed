1. Frontend design of course
2. Categories list
- Add new category should be a markdown
3. Authenticate flow and then save user
4. Deploy Backend to Heroku
5. Deploy Frontend also
6. Followings retrieval, or should I used rapid api avaialbe api instead
7. Better ETL because username =/ userID, people can change username anytime
8. Delete Categories
9. REname categories
10. Remove categories from user following, give the markdown as well
