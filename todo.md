1. Frontend design of course
2. Categories list
- Add new category should be a markdown
3. Authenticate flow and then save user
4. Deploy Backend to Heroku
5. Deploy Frontend also
6. Followings retrieval, or should I used rapid api avaialbe api instead
7. Better ETL because username =/ userID, people can change username anytime
8. Delete Categories
9. REname categories
10. Remove categories from user following, give the markdown as well






FOUND 19 OCTOBER
-SHIT if i rename category, means to rename all the categories inside a following.
- Other implementation is using the ID, which is also mafan ahahha
- I also need to check if i have to use rapid api shit or not



NEXT STEP BETTER PRACTICE
1. WRITE TEST CASE FOR BACKENDD FIRST, I lazy do frontend
2. WRITE ETL ENDPOINT FOLLOWINGS
3. FIX FRONTEND RELOADING



ENABLE SEARCH INSIDE CATEGORY < DONE>
SEARCH IN THE HOMEPAGE IS HALFDONE
^ bcs still have the unresponsive update


bug
Now only the remove category of a user.following inside the following
<!-- Add the error if adding duplicate category in category page -->


<!-- DELETE WORKING BUT NOT THE REACTIVE STATE -->
